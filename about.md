In this time of isolation due to the Covid-19 pandemic, lots of kids are out of school. We think the next best thing to learning from talented teachers in a real classroom, is learning from real people in real time, via video streaming.

Everywhere School is a project assembles live video content that’s engaging, inspiring, entertaining, and of course educational. We don’t produce any content, we merely assemble our favourites from across the internet and present them in an easy and clear interface. We show what’s live, and what’s about to come out.

Everywhere School is a small passion project, done for fun. Please be respectful to our organizers and streamers.

**Content Warning:** though we do our best to include content that’s appropriate for kids, it’s possible that challenging or offensive content may be included by accident. Everywhere School will try to keep content appropriate, but we only curate content, and don’t control it.
