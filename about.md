In this time of isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lots of kids are out of school. We believe that if our children can't be taught by familiar teachers in actual classrooms, one of the next best things is to learn from real people in real time, via video streaming.

Everywhere School is a gateway to live, educational video content created by people and institutions around the internet. We don’t produce any streams ourselves: we simply curate our favourites, presenting what's live and what's scheduled for the hours ahead. These are engaging, inspiring and entertaining options for your family, listed on one easy-to-understand page.

Everywhere School is a small passion project, done for fun. Please be respectful of our organizers and streamers. New events are added to Everywhere School's schedule once or twice a day. 

**Content Warning:** though we do our best to include content that’s appropriate for kids, it’s possible that challenging or offensive content may be included by accident. Everywhere School will do its best to vet the streams it recommends, but we do not control the content that is shown. 

## Why Live?
Live streams, that come on at a predictable time, create a set schedule, which is often sorely needed for kids and parents not used to being at home. The presence of a real teacher, without editing, music, or graphics, giving a lesson in real time, helps create a more personal connection, which is what we need right now.

## Submit a Stream
We welcome submissions of high-quality, family-friendly live streams to the site. You can submit an upcoming stream to our list via our [submission form](https://airtable.com/shrFfyYXe9mhnzwPQ). You can specify the date and time the stream will take place, and the best link to it. Please be aware that submissions usually take between a few hours and a day or so to through our approval process, so avoid sending streams that are already in progress. Not all submissions will be approved.

## Contact

Feel free to get in touch for any reason. You can email us at [hello@everywhereschool.live](mailto:hello@everywhereschool.live). If you are the creator of a stream and wish for it not to be included, please email.

We occasionally release project updates on twitter at [@everywhereschool](https://twitter.com/everywhereschool/).

## Photo Credits

Most of our stream photos come either from the streamers themselves or from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com), which BTW is a great source for great free photos. We can’t credit every photographer individually, but we highly recommend that you visit that site to learn more.
